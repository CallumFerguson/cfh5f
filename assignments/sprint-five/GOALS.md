# Goals

The purpose for my application is to provide SSO for multiplayer games that I make. I will use Google Login SSO so a user can have the same account for multiple different games.

I will implement this for a multiplayer game I made for my computer graphics (CS4610) class. You can see that project here:

Currently in this game (which is played in a web browser), anyone who goes to the url will immediately spawn without having to login. Players do not have names and cannot be differentiated. I will use SSO so the user must login to join the game. I will also display data related to the user. I will get the users name and profile picture, and I will render these above the player in game. I might also create a user profile page where they can set a username instead of using their Google name. This profile page will be viewable by other users.
