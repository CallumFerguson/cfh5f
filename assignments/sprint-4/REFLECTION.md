## Single sign on open source projects

When searching Google and GitHub for open source SSO projects, some of the projects I found were the following:

- S.S Octopus
- Single Sign-On for PHP by jasny
- Sails.js

I chose to use Sails.js because its documentation was the easiest for me to understand. It also had the most stars which means it is popular so it will most likely be easier to find help online on stackoverflow and other sites.

## Progress

I set up the sample app and was able to get it working. I was able to log in and view content that is only available to logged in users.

A problem I had was that I did this on Windows. For the augur assignment I did the setup on Linux, but since I am using Windows for this assignment I had to install Node.js and set up my environment again.
