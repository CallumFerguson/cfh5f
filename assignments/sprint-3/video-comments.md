I participated in a call in time to include it in sprint-2, but I forgot to add which call I participated in in the .md file I submitted last week.

# Discussion Summary

The discussion started with talking about replacing two metrics with one metric that could do the same thing by using filters. For the metric pull request, they discussed the redundancy of the wording of the new metric as well as minor spelling and formatting problems. They also discussed the clarity of the metric and its parameters to make sure it was clear exactly what the metric does and how it should do it. Finally, they discussed the uses of the metric and how you can say its possible uses, but you should not state that the purpose of it is for example tracking people loosing interest because you do not know the reason the became inactive. That is a possibility, but the metric itself only tracks inactivity, not the reason for inactivity. The meeting ended by discussing what working group certain metric should belong to.

# Article Insights/Questions (Also posted in slack)

#### 8 Observations Paper
An insight I got from the paper was that open source doesn't necessarily mean community run. Companies that fund or are in charge of projects can use open sourcing as a tool to improve the software with things like bug bounty payouts. One thing I question is whether or not a project has to be funded to be successful or if a project can survive on its own if enough individuals contribute.

#### Augur Paper
An insight I gained about Augur from the paper is that numbers and statistics on their own is not enough, and activity is not the same as health. The paper addresses this problem with comparison, trajectory, transparently, and visualization. One thing I question is if metrics can be generalized to every project because of how different projects and their management can be.
