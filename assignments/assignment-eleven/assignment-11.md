# Podcast reflections:

I found the reasons each person joined the group to be interesting, especially the person who was working for VMware. I wasn't sure if CHAOSS and Augur were just academic projects or if they had a practical real world use, but after listening to the podcast, I am convinced that it is important.

I also though what they said about metrics not needing an implementation was interesting because it means people can contribute without having to spend the time to fully understand the system and the coding conventions it follows.
